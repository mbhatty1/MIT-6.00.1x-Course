    Ans: True
    
Q2: Imperative knowledge refers to 'how to' methods.

    Ans: True
    
Q3: A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value for y. Without another recipe to be
    told how to pick a starting number, the computer cannot generate one on its own.

    Ans: True
    
    
Exercises 1.3

Q1: True or False? A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root,
    or the trajectory of a missile.

    Ans: False
    
Q2: True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program
    instructions that are read into it.

    Ans: False
    
Q3: A program counter

    Ans: points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.
    
Q4: What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"?

    Ans: The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different 
          place in the sequence.
          
Q5; True or False? In order to compute everything that is computable, every computer must be able to handle the sixteen
    most primitive operations.

    Ans: False

    Ans: Semantics   
    
    
Exercises 1.5

For each of the following expressions, indicate the type of the expression. While you could simply type these expressions
into your shell, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic 
Python expressions.


3.14   Float
-34    Int
True   Bool
None   NoneType
3.0    Float

Q1: 6 + 12 -3

    Ans: 15
   
Q2: 2 * 3.0

    Ans= 6.0
    
Q3: - - 4

    Ans=4
    
Q4; 10/3

    Ans: 3.3333
    
Q5: 10.0/3.0

    Ans: 3.3333

Q6: (2 + 3) * 4

    Ans:  20
    
Q7: 2 + 3 * 4

    Ans: 14
    
Q8: 2**3 + 1

    Ans= 9
    
Q9: 2.1 ** 2.0

    Ans: 4.41
    
Q10: 2.2 * 3.0

    Ans: 6.6000
    

Exercises 1.7
Assume that the expressions are evaluated in the order shown - that is, each problem part is evaluated directly 
  after the previous problem part(s).

Q1: >>> a = 3
    >>> a + 2.0 
    
      Ans: Float,  5.0
      
Q2:   >>> a = a + 1.0
      >>> a 
      
      Ans: FLoat,  4.0
      
Q3:  >>> a = 3
     >>> b
     
     Ans: NoneType,  Error


Exercises 1.9
Assume that the expressions are evaluated in the order shown - that is, each problem part is evaluated directly
  after the previous problem part(s).

Q1:
  >>> a = 3
  >>> a == 5.0
  >>> a 
  
    Ans: int, 3
    
Q2: 
  >>> b = 10
  >>> c = b > 9
  >>> c
  
    Ans: bool, True
    

Exercises 1.10
For each of the following expressions, indicate the type of the expression and the value returned, or, if the 
  evaluation would lead to an error, choose the type 'NoneType' and write the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes) as the value returned.
  
Q1: 3 + 5.0
      Ans: float, 8.0
