Exercise 3

A: 
  True or False? The internal computer representation of any number is always an approximation.
                  False

B:  
  The decimal 11 is what binary?:
                        Ans:  1011
11
1011
1101
cannot be converted

C: 
  True or False? The internal representation of the decimal number 1/10 = 0.1 requires an infinite number of digits.
                          True

After many computations, you get two floating numbers stored in variables a and b. Your code compares the numbers with a == b.

Doing the comparison will always lead to a correct program.
Doing the comparison will sometimes lead to a correct program.
Doing the comparison will never lead to a correct program.

Ans:  Doing the comparison will sometimes lead to a correct program.
