Exercise 2

Consider the following code:

x = 25
epsilon = 0.01
step = 0.1
guess = 0.0

while guess <= x:
    if abs(guess**2 -x) < epsilon:
        break
    else:
        guess += step

if abs(guess**2 - x) >= epsilon:
    print('failed')
else:
    print('succeeded: ' + str(guess))
If this code is executed, it will print succeeded: 4.9999999999998 (or succeeded: 5.0). Remember floating point errors?


Now suppose we try the following:

x = 25
epsilon = 0.01
step = 0.1
guess = 0.0

while guess <= x:
    if abs(guess**2 -x) >= epsilon:
        guess += step

if abs(guess**2 - x) >= epsilon:
    print('failed')
else:
    print('succeeded: ' + str(guess))


Select the answer that best describes what occurs when the above code is executed:


Script successfully completes, and prints out succeeded: 4.9999999999998 (or succeeded: 5.0)
Script successfully completes, but prints out failed
Script successfully completes, but prints out succeeded: followed by some number not really close to 5.0
Correct Ans *****Script enters an infinite loop and never terminates*****. 





Now suppose we try

x = 25
epsilon = 0.01
step = 0.1
guess = 0.0

while abs(guess**2-x) >= epsilon:
    if guess <= x:
        guess += step
    else:
        break

if abs(guess**2 - x) >= epsilon:
    print('failed')
else:
    print('succeeded: ' + str(guess))


Select the answer that best describes what occurs when the above code is executed:


Correct Ans  ***** Script successfully completes, and prints out succeeded: 4.9999999999998 (or succeeded: 5.0) *****
Script successfully completes, but prints out failed
Script successfully completes, but prints out succeeded: followed by some number not really close to 5.0
Script enters an infinite loop and never terminates



Finally, let's use the same code as immediately above, but change the first line to x = 23. Note that the square root of 23 is roughly 4.7958.

Select the answer that best describes what occurs when the modified code is executed:


Script successfully completes, and prints out succeeded: 4.9999999999998 (or succeeded: 5.0)
Correct Ans.  *****Script successfully completes, but prints out failed*****
Script successfully completes, but prints out succeeded: followed by some number not really close to 5.0
Script enters an infinite loop and never terminates
